Must have the CUDA Toolkit installed and nvcc working
Must have Rodinia 3.1 testbench environment to run nn
Only replace the file "nn_cuda.cu" in "nn" folder with the improved one

To build and run nearest neighbor:
	make nn
	./nn filelist_4 -r 3 -lat 30 -lng 90

To generate new data sets:
	Edit gen_dataset.sh and select the size of the desired data set
	make hurricane_gen
	./hurricane_gen <num records> <num files>
Or
	Change directory to data\nn\inputGen
	make hurricanegen
	./hurricanegen <num records> <num files>
	Then copy the filelist file to where nn exists and is made

Full Usage:

  nearestNeighbor [filename] -r [int] -lat [float] -lng [float] [-h]
  
  example:
  $ ./nearestNeighbor filelist.txt -r 5 -lat 30 -lng 90
  
  filename     the filename that lists the data input files
  -r [int]     the number of records to return (default: 10)
  -lat [float] the latitude for nearest neighbors (default: 0)
  -lng [float] the longitude for nearest neighbors (default: 0)
  
  -h, --help   Display the help file  
  
  Note: The filename is required as the first parameter.
